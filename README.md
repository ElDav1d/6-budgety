# 6-budgety
New features added to  Udemy's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!", Section 6: Putting It All Together: The Budget App Project

The app consists in a simple client-sided budget register using ES5.

The goal of this asisted app creation is applying the knowledge of previous lectures and encouraging a classic module based design pattern with separation of concerns.

Once finished the app, the teacher suggests creating more features in order to consolidate the learnings.

My contribution consisted in two features using the Date Object:

1-Display date of register on each item

2-Display date of the last item addition
